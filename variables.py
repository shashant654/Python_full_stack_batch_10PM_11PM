# Variable
x = 6 
y = 7
print(x + y)

# x, y = Variable /Water Bottle
# 6, 7 = Values / Water

# Water Bottle => it is just like a container which contains/stores some quantity of water

# Variable => it is just like a container which contains/stores some value.

# Example: x, name, age, first_name, last_name etc.

## Rules to declare a variable:

1. A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character "_".

Example: _name, name, name1, name_1 etc.

2. A variable name only contains letters, numbers and the underscore character "_".
=> a variable name cannot contain spaces or special characters like !, @, #, $, %, ^, &, * etc.


first_name = "Ansh"
name_1 = "Ujwal"

3. A variable name is always case-sensitive.
=> first_name and FIRST_NAME are two different variables.


Except SQL(Structured Query Language)
Ex: SELECT * FROM accounts_product;
 language, all other programming languages are case-sensitive.

Case-Sensitive :-
1. Uppercase letters/Capital letters: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

2. Lowercase letters/Small letters: a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, v, w, x, y, z

4. Keywords are not allwowed to be used as variable names.

## Keywords: keywords are the words that are predefined in a programming language.
Ex: print, if, else, elif, for, while, break, continue, def, return, import, as, from, in, is, not, and, or, lambda, with, try, except, finally, class, pass, raise, yield, global, nonlocal, assert, del

5. A variable name always should be meaningful.
Ex: first_name, last_name, age, roll_number, total_marks, average_marks etc


print("Shobhit")
