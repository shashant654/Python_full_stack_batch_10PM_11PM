## input function :-
=> it is used to take data from the user.

NOte: by default it gives us string value.
=> that's why we have to specify, data types , whatever we want for output.



# a = 10
# b = 20
# sum = a + b
# print("the sum of a and b is:", sum)

first_value = int(input("Enter first value:"))
second_value = int(input("Enter second value:"))
sum = first_value + second_value
print("the sum of first value and second value is:", sum)


first_name = input("Enter your first name:")
last_name = input("Enter your last name:")
full_name = first_name + " " + last_name
print("Your full name is:", full_name)



A = 10
B = 20
print("the output of this A < B and A == 10 is:", A < B and A == 10)
print("the output of this A > B and A != B is:", A > B and A != B)

print("the output of this A < B or A == 10 is:", A < B or A == 10)

print(A < B or A > 50)
# the output of line number 31 is: True
