## Digital Electronics:-
Logic gates, sequential circuit

1.AND gate :- ( y = A * B  )
=> Truth table :-

A     B      Y
0     0      0
0     1      0
1     0      0
1     1      1

2. OR gate :- (y = A + B)
=> Truth table :-

A     B      Y
0     0      0
0     1      1
1     0      1
1     1      1

3. Xor Gate :
=> if both are similar then it gives 0 otherwise it gives it gives 1.
Truth table :-

A     B      Y
0     0      0
0     1      1
1     0      1 
1     1      0






# AND Operator:-
# It returns True if both the conditions are True.
# otherwise, it returns False.
=> if both are 1 it return 1 otherwise it returns 0

# OR Operator:-
# It returns True if at least one condition is True.
# otherwise, it returns False.
=> if both are false it returns false otherwise it return true.
=> if both are 0 it returns 0 , otherwise it returns 1.



1 => True
0 => False

## Logical Operators:-
# => It is used to combine two or more conditions.
# => it returns boolean value(True or False)


# EX: and, or, not 

# in C and other programming languages:
# and => &&           
# or => ||
# not => !



# AND Operator:-
# It returns True if both the conditions are True.
# otherwise, it returns False.

# OR Operator:-
# It returns True if at least one condition is True.
# otherwise, it returns False.




5. Bitwise Operations in Python:-
# => Bitwise operations are used to perform operations on binary numbers.
# => it works on bits and performs bit by bit operation.

# EX: &, |, ^, ~, 

# AND(&) Operator:-
# It returns 1 if both the bits are 1.
