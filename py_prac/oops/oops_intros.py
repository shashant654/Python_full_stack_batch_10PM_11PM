# Python supports Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), which helps you write clean, reusable, and organized code.
# The two core concepts of OOP are Class and Object.


# A class is a template used to create objects.

# It defines properties (variables) and behaviors (methods/functions) that objects created from it will have.



# class Cricket:

#                     number_of_plyrs = 11
                    
#                     oneday_overs = 50

#                     t20_overs = 20 

                    

# object => it is an instance of a class, that contines real world entity. 

# => it is just like a collection of variables and methods.



class Aditya:
                    hotel = "Gupta Sweets"

OOPS 4 pillors : 

1. Inheritance
2. Encapusulation
3. Polymorphism
4. Abstraction
