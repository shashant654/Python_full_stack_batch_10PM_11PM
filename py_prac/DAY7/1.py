# 2. Assignment Operators
a = 10 Mangoes
b= 30 mangoes

a = a + b OR 10 mangoes + 30 mangoes => 40 mangoes

a = a+ b  => 5 seconds
OR
a += b   => 2 seconds

## Time Complexity => Time taken by any code to run.

## Space Complexity => 


Zeyarat = 5 Projects
Ravi = 10 Projects 


Zayarat = 10 * 5 Projects 

# 2. Assignment Operators

# => It is used to assign a value to a variable.

# Example: =, +=, -=, *=, /=, //=, %=, **=


x = 10
y = 5
print("the sum of x and y is: ", x + y)
# x  = x + y
x += y  # x = x + y
print("the value of x after adding y is: ", x)

a = 10
b = 4

a *= b  # a = a * b
print("the value of a after multiplying b is: ", a)


# 3. Comparison Operators

# => It is used to compare two values.

EX: ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=

G = 10
H = 20
print(G > H ) => False 
print( G < H) => True

print(G == H) => False 

print( G != H ) => True

print( G <= H ) => True

print( G >= H ) => False 


## Logical Operators:-
# => It is used to combine two or more conditions.
# => it returns boolean value(True or False)


# EX: and, or, not 

# in C and other programming languages:
# and => && 
# or => ||
# not => !



# AND Operator:-
# It returns True if both the conditions are True.
# otherwise, it returns False.

# OR Operator:-
# It returns True if at least one condition is True.
# otherwise, it returns False.

A = 10
B = 20

print("the output of this A < B and A == 10 is:", A < B and A == 10)
print("the output of this A > B and A != B is:", A > B and A != B)

print("the output of this A < B or A == 10 is:", A < B or A == 10)

print(A < B or A > 50)





AND Operator:-
# It returns True if both the conditions are True.
# otherwise, it returns False.

OR Operator:-
# It returns True if at least one condition is True.
# otherwise, it returns False.
------------------------------------- 
A = 10
B = 20

print(A < B or A > 50)

True or False => True 

print(A < B or A == 10)

True or True => True 

print( A < B and A == 10) 

True and  True =>  True 

print( A > B and A != B )

False and True => False
