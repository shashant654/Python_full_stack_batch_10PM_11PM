## conditional statement :-
# => A conditional statement is used to perform different actions based on whether a certain condition is true or false. It typically involves

# two conditions :- if , else


if Rohit reached the class on time:
                    print("Rohit will attend the class")
else:
                    print("Rohit will not attend the class")



# NOte: ":" colon => it is used to define the body of any statement in python.

# a = 40
# b = 30

# if a > b:
#          print("a is greater than b")
#          print("it is code for if block")
#          print("another statement in if block")

# else:
#     print("b is greater than a")
#     print("it is code for else block")
#     print("another statement in else block")

# print("hii, guys, this is out of if else block")


# NOtes : in python we use colon : to define the body of if and else, any loop.

# in c language :-

# in any statement we use curly braces { } to define the body of  if and else,  any loop.

# Semicolon ; is used to terminate any statement in c language.

# if (a > b)
# {
#    printf("a is greater than b");
#    print("it is code for if block");
#    print("another statement in if block");
# }

# else
# {
#   printf("b is greater than a");
#   print("it is code for else block");
# }



# print("Indentation in python")
# print("the is the code for testing indentation in python")

#  print("hello")

# NOtes : Indentation is very important in python.
# => backbone of python 


# if condition is true :
#                     print("it will print this line of code  this")
# else:
#                     print("it will print this line of code  that")

# num = int(input("Enter any number: "))

# if num == 99:
#     print("you have entered 99")
# else:
#     print("you have not entered 99")
                               

           

# my_number = 777


# if (my_number < 500):
#     print("bhai ye print hone chahiye agr condition true hai to")
# else:
#     print("bhai ye print hone chahiye agr condition false hai to")



# NOte: we can keep our condition in parenthesis () but it is not mandatory in python.
